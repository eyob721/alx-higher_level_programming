# Alx - Higher Level Programming

In this repo we learn about higher level programming concepts. The projects
mostly use Python and JavaScript programming languages. We start learning the
fundamental concepts of these languages like formatting and manipulating strings,
data types and variables, taking user arguments, and so on to more advanced concepts like OOP, serialization and deserialization of JSON files, unit-testing, ... etc.
